# Hi, I'm Dean ðŸ‘‹

### And this is my Managers README

Firstly, I'm looking forward to working with you! This document is not supposed to replace real 1:1 time getting to know you; it might help you get an understanding of me and help keep me accountable in my job in helping you.

## My role as Engineering Lead

I see my role here at PEXA as one of an enabler. I like to use the term force multiplier from time to time, but when I reflect, what I genuinely want to do is help you to become the best engineer you can be.

In a little more detail, I strive to:

- Make sure you are both successful and happy: I want you to improve your technical skills, grow your career, and enjoy your work.
- Bring experience and consistency to our team: I have experience leading technology teams and want to ensure that we are using the right tools at the right time.
- Drive initiatives across Technology that will directly feed into your Learning & Development, as well as general ways of working.
- Reduce the friction you face day-to-day. This will come in all shapes and sizes; some will be quick wins we can drive together, some might be larger pieces of work that will need the whole team behind.

Sometimes people read my role as _"the person who will tell us what to do, and how to do it"_. I am not here to do that; I am here to make sure that you have to tools and resources to get the job done. I will most certainly have opinions about many things, and I expect to be respectfully challenged by you! I am not here to dictate or tell you what to do. I will be as direct as I can in my support of your work.

> I see myself as a force multiplier, by that I mean someone who can help move your career forward by supporting your personal L&D, aligned to our technology strategy, and removing potential roadblocks or friction to enable you to do your best work.

## One-on-ones

I will schedule a fortnightly 30 minute catchup in your calendar for a 1:1. I like to start with a 2 week interval as a starting point, we can work out the cadence that suits you best moving forward - we can adjust at any time.

**This time is for you!** I will be able to give some updates on company or technology strategy; ultimately, I want to use this time to check in with you and see if there is anything I can do to help you on your journey. I want to move the focus away from a standup-like conversation or status report. Use this time to focus on how you are tracking with your team, tribe and career in general.

If there is something in particular you would like to go deep on, send out a rough agenda or outline of what you would like to talk about or achieve and I will prepare as best I can.

> I like to give ownership of this relationship to you. I will of course guide and start the process, ultimately this is your time for your development.

## My Schedule

I am living outside of Metro Melbourne at the moment, so you can expect to see me in the office 1-2 days/week (once we are back in the office!)

I wake up early (5am) to get some personal work done, sometimes to get a jump on my working day. I am online at 9 to 5, and I will generally block out a lunch break (larger than 1hr if I work in the mornings) so please try to respect that. I will rarely try to book anything in your calendars between 12-2.

### Communication with me

Outlook Calendar rules my day, so the best way to find structured time with me is to block out some time via Outlook. I am also 100% available on Slack, although I may be slow to respond if I am in meetings.

I prefer asynchronous communication since we are all remote, but recognise the power of a meeting. Feel free to use whichever medium suits you best.

> I have an "Open Door" policy - feel free to reach out whenever you like, we do not need to abide by calendar invites to start talking.

## What I am working on

Currently my focus is on the following areas:

- Giving and Recieving feedback - some of the softer skills
- Making my work more visible to the team, becoming more transparent
- Commiting to fewer things (so hard with so much to do!)

## Feedback

I am working hard to get better at giving and receiving feedback. At the time of writing this README we are going through a global pandemic, so giving timely and constructive feedback is much harder. I am spending a little more time reflecting and using our internal CultureAmp product to give feedback where possible.

I will try my best to give specific, objective and timely feedback where I can - if you would like more or less feedback, please let me know.

> **Any feedback you have for me is always much appreciated.**
